# Versions
## 2.2.32
BugFix. Labels could be empty. isEmailsDraft now checks whether or labels do exists 

## 2.2.29
reversal on 2.2.28.  Emails are by default checked for validity, however optional parameter checkIfEmailIsValid can be set to false, whereby emails are not checked, and isValid is set to true.  ParseGmailApi.parseMessage() always set isValid=true (without checking).

## 2.2.28
@IReceiver.isValid is now required (was optional). Set is as true as default by ParseGmailApi.parseMessage(). Validation appears to be redundant, as emails from the gmail api, should be  correct

## 2.2.27
add  isEmailValid: boolean function, check whether or not an email is valid

## 2.2.26
add  isValid?: boolean to interface IReceiver. comments: Optional. Possible to marked users non-valid emails, as not valid, for later evaluation 

## 2.2.25
bugFix, checks for undefined values indexHeaders(), causing runtime errors in certain cases

Fixes bug in the original code (v2.1.0), as some attachments are not correctly recognized as attachments 
Tests added
Forked from `https://github.com/EmilTholin/gmail-api-parse-message`, v2.1.0, some parts converted to typescript, as necessary

## 2.1.0 (org version)
